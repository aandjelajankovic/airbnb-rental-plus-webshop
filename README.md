# 🛒 Webshop – E-commerce Store  

A rental platform for apartments. This project focuses on a **responsive and user-friendly UI**, allowing users to browse and view available apartments.  

As part of the assignment, I also developed a **simple webshop** featuring five products that we photographed and edited in Photoshop. While **booking functionality is not implemented**, users can browse available apartments and add products to their cart to have them ready upon arrival.
